 `debian-debootstrap-ports` Docker image for multiple architectures (ports)

## Usage

Before using this Docker image, you need to configure binfmt-support on your Docker host. This works both locally and remotely (e.g., using boot2docker or swarm).

```console
$ docker run --rm --privileged polyarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes
```

Once configured, you can run a `loong64` image from your `x86_64` Docker host.

```console
$ docker run -it --rm polyarch/debian-debootstrap-ports:loong64-trixie-sid-qemu-v9.0.2-2 uname -m
loongarch64
```

powerpc/ppc64   | Motorola/IBM PowerPC  | Port for many of the Apple Macintosh PowerMac models, and CHRP and PReP open architecture machines.                                                                                |
sh4             | SuperH                | Port to Hitachi SuperH processors. Also supports the open source J-Core processor.                                                                                                 |

In addition this project produces builds for `loong64`, `powerpc`, `ppc64`, and `sparc64`.
The `alpha` architecture is currently non-functional due to a debootstrap issue.
